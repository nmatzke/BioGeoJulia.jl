	numstates_from_numareas(numareas[, maxareas, include_null_range])

Calculates the number of possible states in the state space (e.g., the number of possible geographic 
ranges). The inputs are the number of areas (`numareas`), and the maximum range size (`maxareas`).

If `numareas` = `maxareas`, then the size of the state space is 2^`numareas`. This is
because, for each area, a species could be absent (0) or present (1). Therefore, if
there is one area, there are 2*1=2 possible ranges (0 and 1). If there are two areas, there 
are 2*2=4 possible ranges (00, 01, 10, 11). If there are three areas, there are 2*2*2=8 
possible ranges (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111), etc.

The `include_null_range` input, if set to `true` allows the "all absent" range (e.g. 000). 
If set to `false`, this range is disallowed, decreasing the size of the state space by 1.

NOTE: The size of the state space is a fundamental constraint on the computational speed
of likelihood calculations for biogeographical models using matrix exponentiation, ODEs 
(ordinary differential equations), etc. Researchers must think carefully about how large 
of a state space they require to test their hypotheses, and whether their analysis will 
run fast enough (or at all!).  If `numareas`=20 and `maxareas`=20, the size of the state
space is 1,048,576. Trying to calculate likelihoods for such a huge state space will likely
just fill up computer memory and then crash the program.

Researchers (and reviewers and editors!) should clearly recognize that any computational
inference is inherently a compromise between a very complex reality, and the memory and 
speed limitations of computers. Different people might reach different conclusions about
where exactly this compromise should end up. I tend to think that running somewhat simpler and 
faster models, thus allowing more time to run variant models, model checks, etc., is more 
valuable than setting up the most complex model you can think of, devoting months of 
computing time to it, and then either (a) losing all of that work when it crashes, or (b)
treating the output as gospel because you don't have the time or money available to do
anything else.

	areas_list_to_states_list(area_nums[, maxareas, include_null_range])

Provides the list of possible states (e.g., geographic ranges) in the state space. The 
inputs are:

* `area_nums` - The list of areas. Each area is described with a number. This is done
with the `collect` function, e.g. collect(1:3).

* `maxareas` - The maximum number of areas occupied per geographic range. See
`numstates_from_numareas` for a discussion of how the state space grows (rapidly!) 
with `numareas` and `maxareas`.

* `include_null_range` - if set to `true`, allows the "all absent" range (e.g. 000). 
If set to `false`, this range is disallowed, decreasing the size of the state space by 1.
