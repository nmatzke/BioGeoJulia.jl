Hi all! I have been working with Julia's ODE tools and I find them amazing! I have a quick, possibly dumb question, however: Let's say my ODE has a rate parameter that should vary in time as a deterministic function of an external, empirical time series (e.g. a temperature curve from weather data). I think this would require something like a subfunction that (a) knows the absolute value of time-after-start-point, and (b) looks up the relevant temperature on the (smoothed) temperature curve. Is this kind of thing possible? Cheers and thanks!

function foo(u, p, t)
    ... p(t)
end
work?

Pkg.add("DataInterpolations") # for LinearInterpolation
using DataInterpolations

u = rand(5)
t = 0:4
interp = LinearInterpolation(u,t);

interp.u
interp.t  # times corresponding to the u points

interp(3.5) # Gives the linear interpolation value at t=3.5
interp(3.1) # Gives the linear interpolation value at t=3.5
interp(3.2) # Gives the linear interpolation value at t=3.5
interp(3.3) # Gives the linear interpolation value at t=3.5
interp(3.0) # Gives the linear interpolation value at t=3.5
interp[3]
